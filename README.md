OnlyVans - A Bootsrap Portfolio project by Lane Harbarger

1. Introduction
   I started my portfolio project initially as a resume and decided to build a site for OnlyVans. Given the subject matter of what we have been working on for this course, it seemed like the perfect segway.

2. Design and Implementation
   I started by designing the divs, sections, and content without any formatting.

After designing the framework for the site I used CSS and bootstrap to make the site responsive.

I decided to go to a single page for now and will implement additional pages and features in future courses.

Images were pulled from Google image search, including the logo. None of the images are licensed as this is a parody of a popular social media site geared towards tongue-in-cheek humor for camping fans.

3. Roadmap for Future Development
   In the future I am looking to add database functionality for a renting and reservation system as well as a shopping cart for merchandise.

4. Conclusions
   This is a rudimentary front end for a camper van booking site. It showcases van inventory and branded merchandise.
